Overview

In Monero we've discovered and patched a critical bug that affects all CryptoNote-based cryptocurrencies, and allows for the creation of an unlimited number of coins in a way that is undetectable to an observer unless they know about the fatal flaw and can search for it.

We patched it quite some time ago, and confirmed that the Monero blockchain had NEVER been exploited using this, but until the hard fork that we had a few weeks ago we were unsure as to whether or not the entire network had updated.

Once we were certain that the network had updated, we notified all active and affected CryptoNote coins, including CryptoNote themselves, Bytecoin, Forknote, Boolberry, DashCoin, and DigitalNote.

Note that, at this time, only Monero, Aeon, Boolberry, and Forknote have updated. We have given the other currencies as much time as possible, but cannot hold back disclosure any longer.

We strongly caution against anyone using, trading, exchanging, or running services involving the following currencies affected by this issue: Bytecoin, DashCoin, DigitalNote

Start forknote daemon v2.0.1.1
1) Dble click forknoted icon.

2) Launch simplewallet with dble click simplewallet icon.

3) Solo mining CPU through RPC. Dble click miner icon.
(you must edit miner.bat file with your wallet address and number of CPU core to match your machine)

Method to send payment in simplewallet
transfer 0 By101010101010101010101010101 25

Effect
this will send 25 BIC to wallet By101010101010101010101010101

Breakdown of the transaction
0 represent mixin count. Changes to 0 (number of transactions yours is indistinguishable from)
By101010101010101010101010101 represents destination wallet
25 represents the number of BIC to be send from your wallet


Method to send payment using payment id
transfer 0 By101010101010101010101010101 25 -p Ced341010101010
this will send 5 BIC to wallet By101010101010101010101010101 with supplied payment ID, most commonly used to send coins to an exchange wallet.

Transaction response
Money successfully sent, transaction 987654321
987654321 represents transaction hash

These transactions are sent anonimously to the blockchain shielding both the sending and receiving wallet address using cryptonote ring signature technology. Miners are awarded a fee for successfully added the block to the chain and the transaction is now part of the ledger.
